I found a youtube tutorial that went over writing a simple interpreted language in TypeScript, but since I wanted an excuse to get better at Go, I decided to follow along using Go. I made tweaks and adjustments on top of the guide, so it's got some extra features. This project is what really piqued my interest in programming language design and implementation, a field I am still very much interested in",
